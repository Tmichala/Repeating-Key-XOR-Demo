# Repeating-Key-XOR-Demo
Demonstration of Gradio prototype hosting with a rudimentary vigenere frequency analysis solver.

I created a simple python program to attack a very specific type of insecure encryption (repeating key XOR, similar to a Vigenere cipher), using hamming distance and frequency analysis to derive candidate key lengths and ultimately decrypt the ciphertext. While the attack itself has no practical application in the real world, the skills I learned from this undertaking have been applicable to other projects.
